# ProtSeq2StrucAlpha

ProtSeq2StrucAlpha is a deep learning framework designed to predict Foldseek structural tokens directly from protein amino acid sequences. By leveraging a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, this project aims to bridge the gap between protein sequences and their structural representations, facilitating rapid structural annotation and analysis.

## Overview

The core objective of ProtSeq2StrucAlpha is to translate protein sequences into their corresponding structural token sequences as defined by Foldseek. This approach enables:

- **Efficient Structural Annotation**: Rapid prediction of structural features without the need for computationally intensive methods.
- **Enhanced Protein Analysis**: Facilitates downstream tasks such as protein classification, function prediction, and interaction analysis.
